# Smart Brain

This app, after logging in / registering, will allow you to paste in the URL of an image, and will then draw a blue square around the face in that image (multi-face recognition in progress).

It utilizes React for the front-end, Node and Express for the back-end, and a PostgreSQL database.

This was done as a project for Andrei Neagoie's Udemy course "The Complete Web Developer 2018" -> GREAT course I learned a lot and highly reccomend it as a learning resource.
